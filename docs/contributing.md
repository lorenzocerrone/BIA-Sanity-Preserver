## 🤝 Contributing

Such a project can only thrive with the help of the community, to make sure that it stays up-to-date and useful for everyone. Here’s how you can contribute:

* If you have ideas for new tools or improvements, **open an issue** 💡
* If you test some tools, and had an issue let us know by **opening an issue** 🐛
* If you know your way around pixi and want to add a tool or improve an existing setup, **submit a pull request** 🚀
* If the documentation is lacking or unclear, feel free to suggest improvements via **pull requests** ✍️

## 🧪 Testing

Each environment is automatically installed on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows using GitHub Actions to ensure cross-platform compatibility. The tools themselves are not tested beyond installation.
